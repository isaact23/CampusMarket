In Python, I have types Message (id, to_id, from_id, title, content), Transaction (id, product_id, buyer_id, seller_id), Product (id, name, description, price, owner_id), and User (id, username, email, password).

Database functions:

def add_product(product: Product) -> int:
def lookup_product(id: int) -> Product:
def delete_product(id: int) -> bool:
def add_user(user: User) -> int:
def lookup_user(id: int) -> User:
def delete_user(id: int) -> bool:
def add_message(message: Message) -> int:
def lookup_message(id: int) -> Message:
def delete_message(id: int) -> bool:
def add_transaction(transaction: Transaction) -> int:
def lookup_transaction(id: int) -> Transaction:

List a full set of pytest cases for me to write out.
